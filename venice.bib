	abstract = {The science of cities seeks to understand and explain regularities observed in the world’s major urban systems. Modelling the population evolution of cities is at the core of this science and of all urban studies. Quantitatively, the most fundamental problem is to understand the hierarchical organization of city population and the statistical occurrence of megacities. This was first thought to be described by a universal principle known as Zipf’s law1,2; however, the validity of this model has been challenged by recent empirical studies3,4. A theoretical model must also be able to explain the relatively frequent rises and falls of cities and civilizations5, but despite many attempts6–10 these fundamental questions have not yet been satisfactorily answered. Here we introduce a stochastic equation for modelling population growth in cities, constructed from an empirical analysis of recent datasets (for Canada, France, the UK and the USA). This model reveals how rare, but large, interurban migratory shocks dominate city growth. This equation predicts a complex shape for the distribution of city populations and shows that, owing to finite-time effects, Zipf’s law does not hold in general, implying a more complex organization of cities. It also predicts the existence of multiple temporal variations in the city hierarchy, in agreement with observations5. Our result underlines the importance of rare events in the evolution of complex systems11 and, at a more practical level, in urban planning.},

Is the heritage sector better defining historic places, or because their complexity defies verbal description, it re-iterates simplified concepts? Are existing boundaries between disciplines such as architecture, planning and landscape design enriching or constraining heritage? This paper analyses the urban morphology of Venice and the Piazza San Marco, a key context in which architecture emerges as legitimised vehicle for urban regeneration in early modernity. Looking at the relationship between the Piazza and the urban networks of Venice alongside intangible spatial practices and symbols, the paper makes three contributions to urban conservation: a) it defines the HUL as the interrelationship of the anonymous city with the authored products of design, b) it revisits the foundations of early modern consciousness about architecture, urban conservation and innovation in order to better understand interdisciplinary knowledge in the heritage sector and c) it approaches heritage as social construction, involving the selection of structures, from buildings to entire areas, and from legal documents and political instruments to ideologies through which societies are seen from dominant positions, often disguising conflict.},

	abstract = {This study compares the urban form of large European cities using fractal dimensions. Fractal dimensions are computed for built-up areas using data available in the Imperviousness High Resolution Layer dataset (EEA, 2012), and are estimated following two different methodologies; the binary approach which considers only two classes, developed land and non-developed land and the grayscale approach in which the built-up intensity, as expressed by the soil sealing degree is explicitly taken into account. Fractal dimensions are estimated for the 60 European cities with population exceeding one million. Using the boundaries defined in Urban Atlas the functional urban Area (FUA) is divided in two parts, the core of the urban area and the peri-urban ring area. Fractal dimensions are computed for each of these three spatial entities. Results show that the grayscale fractal dimension values at the FUA level are 1.18-1.55 and that the equivalent binary ones are always higher with values between 1.34 and 1.83. There is a high correlation between the two sets of fractal dimensions, as well as between the fractal dimension and the overall percentage of built-up area. Cities are also compared across regions (UK-Ireland, Scandinavia, Central, South, East). Significantly higher fractal values at the FUA level are reported in the cities located on the highly urbanized European corridor spanning from South UK to the Netherlands, Belgium, the Ruhr region and Northern Italy, while East European and Scandinavian cities form a distinct group with lower fractal dimension values.  Another group of cities with high FUA fractal dimensions includes the coastal South European cities Porto, Lisbon, Naples and Barcelona. At the CΟRΕ urban areas, the highest fractal values are observed in the largest cities (London, Paris, Berlin) which are compactly built-up.},

	abstract = {Cellular automata (CA) have been increasingly used in simulating urban expansion and land-use dynamics. However, most urban CA models rely on empirical data for deriving transition rules, assuming that the historical trend will continue into the future. Such inertia CA models do not take into account possible external interventions, particularly planning policies, and thus have rarely been used in urban and land-use planning. This paper proposes to use artificial immune systems (AIS) as a technique for incorporating external interventions and generating alternatives in urban simulation. Inspired by biological immune systems, the primary process of AIS is the evolution of a set of ‘antibodies’ that are capable of learning through interactions with a set of sample ‘antigens’. These ‘antibodies’ finally get ‘matured’ and can be used to identify/classify other ‘antigens’. An AIS-based CA model incorporates planning policies by altering the evolution mechanism of the ‘antibodies’. Such a model is capable of generating different scenarios of urban development under different land-use policies, with which the planners will be able to answer ‘what if’ questions and to evaluate different options. We applied an AIS-based CA model to the simulation of urban agglomeration development in the Pearl River Delta in southern China. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can be very useful in exploring various planning scenarios of urban development.},

These signs show the development of ‘functionally hierarchical’ concepts reﬂected in domestic architecture and settlement planning.

	abstract = {Spatial structure is hypothesized to be an important factor in the origin of life, wherein encapsulated chemical reaction networks came together to form systems capable adaptive complexification via Darwinian evolution. In this work, we use a computational model to investigate how different patterns of environmental connectivity influence the emergence of adaptive processes in simulated systems of self-amplifying networks of interacting chemical reactions (autocatalytic cycles, ``ACs''). Specifically, we measured the propensity for adaptive dynamics to emerge in communities with nine distinct patterns of inter-AC interactions, across ten different patterns of environmental connectivity. We found that the pattern of connectivity can dramatically influence the emergence of adaptive processes; however, the effect of any particular spatial pattern varied across systems of ACs. Relative to a well-mixed (fully connected) environment, each spatial structure that we investigated amplified adaptive processes for at least one system of ACs and suppressed adaptive processes for at least one other system. Our findings suggest that there may be no single environment that universally promotes the emergence of adaptive processes in a system of interacting components (e.g., ACs). Instead, the ideal environment for amplifying (or suppressing) adaptive dynamics will depend on the particularities of the system.},

	abstract = {Angular street segment measures are used to analyse the degree to which network intelligibility
of cities becomes evident at different scales. It is shown that the phenomenon is not scaleinvariant, but has a distinct peak at which correlations are highest, providing a recognisable
scale of any given city map that results from its broad network structure rather than individual
features such as mean street length. For actual street networks it is found that this scale
corresponds with the radius at which Syntax measures such as choice best predict human
movement within the city.
These results may explain the relationship between individual navigation strategies and urban
form, and why Space Syntax techniques as different as centrality measures and agent simulation
should both be effective in predicting movement. Syntactic intelligibility appears to operate at a
particular radius around 2-4km; at this scale, both a perfectly informed strategy of route
minimisation (network centrality measures) and a locally opportunistic navigation (stochastic
agent simulations) yield similar patterns. Empirical evidence indicates this is the scale at which
both correlate with observed movement and of an average journey length. The networks
examined can thus be considered to be optimised to convey the most relevant information on
likely journeys to navigators throughout the network, and to do it at the most useful scale.},
